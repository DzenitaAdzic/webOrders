# webOrders
On the server side is created a RESTful web service for retrieving data from the database, 
and publishing using Internet services in JSON format. 
On the client side, a graphical user interface was developed using JavaFX Scene Builder 
and business logic by using Java API for JSON Processing for JSON data parsing from a 
web service and a JAX-RS 2.0 client API for communicating with the web service.
